#### Bridges (unmanaged switches) and breakout networks (INET, MGMT, etc): Links for these network objects must be defined here, not in device links (links)
networks:
  MGMT:                                                     # Network object name
    management: true                                        # To identify the bridge used for mgmt, all pre-defined mgmt interfaces connect this
    type: pnet1/ ec_bridge1                                 # The EVE-NG cloud name or CML bridge name
    links: [ISP, R1, R2, XNET-ASA, CORE-SWI]                # List of nodes that connect to this bridge. Uses the next local interface and remote device pre-defined mgmt interfaces
    ethernet: 8                                             # Required for CML if more than 1 connection, creates an unmanaged_switch (xx_SWI) to connect all devices
  INET:
    type: pnet9/ ec_virbr0                                  # Internet breakout, EVE-NG cloud name or CML bridge name
    links: [ISP]                                            # List of connected nodes, uses the next local and remote interface. By default they will be assigned an IP by DHCP
    ethernet: 8                                             # Again only required for CML if more than 1 device connected
  XNET-SWI:
    type: bridge/ unmanaged_switch                          # Unmanaged local switch/bridge
    links: [R1, R2, XNET-ASA]                               # List of connected nodes, uses the next local and remote interface

#### All node links: Links between nodes, this CANNOT include any network links (PNET/ External connector or bridge/ unmanaged switch)
links:                                                      # The next available interface on each node is automatically used
  ISP: [R1, R2]                                             # Dict key is node_a, and dict value is a list of all the devices it connects to
